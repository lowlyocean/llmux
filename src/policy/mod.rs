//! Switch policies for model switching decisions.
//!
//! The policy trait is intentionally rich — it receives detailed context about
//! queue depths, in-flight counts, and timing so that future policies can make
//! sophisticated decisions. The initial [`FifoPolicy`] uses only a fraction
//! of this data.
